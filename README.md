# Terraform AWS EC2 Deployment (Amazon Linux 2023 ARM64)

This project demonstrates how to use Terraformâ€™s `aws_ami` data source to automatically fetch the **latest Amazon Linux 2023 AMI** and launch a matching EC2 instance.

##  What this project does
- Uses `data "aws_ami"` to always pick the newest AMI version.
- Filters for the **arm64** architecture.
- Launches a lightweight **t4g.micro** instance.

##  How to Run
```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```
# Results

- Terraform fetched the latest Amazon Linux 2023 ARM64 image.

- Created a t4g.micro EC2 instance successfully in us-east-1.

- Verified on the AWS console (see screenshots below).
